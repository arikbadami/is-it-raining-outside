# About

This is a simple react application that is used to fetch and show the weather data either based on the users device location or whatever city the user enters inside the search bar.

## TechStack

The frontend is built using React.


The API used is from openweathermap.org


Axios is used while calling the API


The app promotes the use of PWA i.e - In a browser, the user is asked to install the PWA
Only in the PWA can the user use the weather forecast functionality
